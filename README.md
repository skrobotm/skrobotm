- 👋 Hi, I’m @skrobotm
- 👀 I’m interested in motion tracking, motor recovery in neurologic diseases, neuroscience, engineering, biomechanics and molecular biology.
- 🌱 I’m currently researching motor recovery after stroke and neuromechanics of the brain and spinal cord.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on deep learning-based markerless limb tracking.
- 📫 You can reach me over our Charité group website (check out link in profile).
